# Hi there 👋

💼 I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at BigPanda

⚛️ I primarily work in React and Typescript. I love to use styled-components for styling, react-query for state and cache management, react-final-form for handling state mangement with forms.

## Current Projects

💥 I'm currently learning & working on familiarizing myself with popular frameworks like Next.js and Remix Browser Framework.

### Kudos 👍🏽
Send people their props or thoughtful notes. This project uses Remix, Prisma and MongoDB to create and save users information including their kudos to other users. It also uses Tailwind for styling and AWS S3 to store photo uploads.
