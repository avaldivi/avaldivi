# Hi there 👋

💼 I'm currently a Senior UI Engineer at Salesloft, a market leading sales engagement tool. I've worked on design-systems, Admin tooling for CRM Integrations between Salesforce, Hubspot, and Microsoft Dynamics, and now Analytics.

⚛️ I primarily work in React and Typescript. I love to use styled-components for styling, react-query for state and cache management, react-final-form for handling state mangement with forms.

💥 I'm currently learning & working on familiarizing myself with popular frameworks like Next.js and Remix Browser Framework.

📹 I live-stream a series on Twitch/LinkedIn/X (fka Twitter) weekly on Tuesdays at 12PM EST/9AM PST based on understanding the foundational blocks of astrology to teach people how to read their natal chart by building a website in public called the **[Astrology & Javascript Series](https://astrology-javascript-series.vercel.app/)**.
